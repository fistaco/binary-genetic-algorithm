# Overview
The code in this repository implements a genetic algorithm (GA) that optimises the number of bits set to 1 in a bit string of customisable length. Such a GA encourages the use of an interface or abstract class, modular methods, templates, and other techniques that inspired me to implement it as an educational exercise.
